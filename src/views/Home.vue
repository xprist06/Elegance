            <h3>Growing Market</h3>
            <p>
              The global demand for luxury properties continues to rise, driven
              by high-net-worth individuals (1M+ USD) and ultra-high-net-worth
              individuals (30M+ USD), as well as international buyers.

            <h3>Stability</h3>
            <p>
              Historically, luxury real estate has shown resilience to market
              downturns and has offered attractive returns. Prime locations tend
              to experience steady appreciation in property values.

          <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>Risk diversification</h3>
            <p>
              Luxury properties have historically demonstrated low correlation
              with traditional asset classes such as stocks and bonds, making
              them a valuable addition to investment portfolios.
            </p>

          <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>Lifestyle benefits</h3>
            <p>
              Ownership of luxury properties offers lifestyle perks, prestige,
              and personal enjoyment. Luxury properties can serve as private
              retreats, vacation homes, or legacy assets for future generations.
